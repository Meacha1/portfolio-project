# Addis Building Cost Estimator

[![Project Screenshot](public/images/logo.png)](http://18.235.233.160/)

Building Cost Estimator is a web-based application built with Node.js that allows users to estimate the cost of their construction projects. Users can sign up, provide project information, and receive a cost estimation based on their input data. The application provides a convenient way for users to track and manage their project costs.

This project is a collaboration between three individuals, combining their civil engineering expertise with software engineering skills to create a comprehensive building cost estimation tool.

**Project Inspiration:** The Addis Building Cost Estimator was born out of a desire to simplify the process of estimating construction project costs. Our team recognized the challenges faced by individuals and organizations in accurately estimating the cost of construction projects. We wanted to create a tool that would empower users to plan and budget their projects effectively, leveraging our combined knowledge of civil engineering and software engineering.
